## Assumption

Project finished!

Program can monitor income and expenses.
Expenses are categorised. User can add purchases and see how much money has been spent in individual categories, as well as how much in total.
The balance function is used to monitor the current amount of money held by the user.
It's possible to save and load all data to purchases.txt file.
The program has 3 sorting functions implemented:
    1.Sort All – sort the entire shopping list and display it so that the most expensive purchases are at the top of the list.
    2.Sort By Type – show which category eats the most money. If a category has no purchases in it the total sum should be $0.
    3.Sort Certain Type – same as Sort All, but for a specific category.
